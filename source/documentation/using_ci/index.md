Setting up a CI service helps you make sure your team are delivering new features without breaking existing functionality. CI will deploy software automatically, but only if the tests pass. This helps you to iterate code faster and with greater confidence, a huge benefit once the codebase becomes larger and more complex.

Tools we have seen used to manage the tests and deployments include Travis, Circle, TeamCity and Jenkins. Detailed instructions on configuring Travis or Jenkins are below.

- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) is cloud-based, has a free tier, and is commonly used when a team want to start deploying prototypes from shared GitHub repositories - rather than code running locally on a particular machine. This is equivalent to linking GitHub repositories to Heroku, and takes less than ten minutes. [Set up Travis](#use-travis)
- [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) is more complex, needs detailed technical knowledge, and requires its own infrastructure. [Set up Jenkins](#push-an-app-with-jenkins)

Security is a key concern when setting up a CI system that interacts with a PaaS. You should protect confidential data and your systems by:

- running all tests as a [low-privilege PaaS user](#credentials-for-automated-accounts)
- not exposing your PaaS credentials publicly; you should store them in encrypted form and decrypt only during runtime.
- running your tests in a dedicated environment before deploying to production

For security reasons, GOV.UK PaaS will lock your account if your CI system makes multiple failed login attempts in a short period of time. This can happen if you provide incorrect or expired login details. See the [Failed login rate limit](#failed-login-rate-limit) section for more information.

### Credentials for automated accounts

In order to avoid developer credentials leaking, particularly those with admin rights, you should request a dedicated PaaS user account for use by your CI service. If you want to deploy to multiple spaces with your CI tool, use a different user account for each. Each user should only have `SpaceDeveloper` access to a single space within your organisation.

To request a PaaS user account for a CI service, contact us at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) and tell us the email address of the CI user. This should be a unique email address, not already used by another PaaS account. If other people within your team need to be able to reset the password then we recommend that you use a group email address that they also receive the email for.

We set up user accounts for CI services in the same way as user accounts for people; the accounts have the `SpaceDeveloper` role in the `sandbox` space.
